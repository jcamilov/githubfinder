### About this project
It allows to search profiles of Github users and display their info and some stats about every profile's projects.

### Main points
- Dealing with third-party API (Github)
- Using reducerds and the useReducer Hook to manipulate states and so compare them to the use of context API
- Uses pages, routes, actions file, Axios, useRef
- Using Tailwind and DaisyUI to ease the design
- Deployed in netlify to learn about it
